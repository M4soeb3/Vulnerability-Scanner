# Vulnerability Scanner

## Description
This Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based tool designed to help identify common security vulnerabilities in web applications. It automates the process of detecting potential security issues such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards, Security Misconfiguration, and Sensitive Data Exposure.

## Features
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Scans for possible SQL injection vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries.
- **XSS Detection**: Tests for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities where malicious scripts are injected into web pages.
- **CSRF Detection**: Identifies forms that are susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery.
- **Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Detection**: Checks if the application improperly redirects users to external URLs.
- **Security Misconfiguration Detection**: Scans for common misconfigurations in web applications.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure Detection**: Looks for sensitive data that may be exposed to unauthorized parties.
